Put the SD card into your device, and connect either the ethernet cable or WiFi adapter. Now power up the device by inserting the micro usb cable.

It can take a few minutes for the device to boot up and appear on the dashboard.

While you wait resin.io is partitioning your SD card, installing a custom Linux environment, and establishing a secure connection with the resin.io servers.

If you have a class 10 SD card and a fast internet connection your device should appear on the dashboard in around 7 minutes. Note that Class 4 SD cards can take up to 3 times longer so it's well worth investing in the fastest card you
can find.
