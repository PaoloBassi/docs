Put the SD card into your device. Note the Nitrogen6x board has 2 microSD slots, you will want to insert your SD card into the slot on the **top side** of the board. Now connect either the ethernet cable or a WiFi adapter. Once you have all the bits in place, power up the device by inserting the barrel jack cable into the power port.

It can take a few minutes for the device to boot up and appear on the dashboard, so grab some tea while you wait.

While you wait, resin.io is partitioning your SD card, installing a custom Linux environment, and establishing a secure connection with our servers.

If you have a class 10 SD card and a fast internet connection your device should appear on the dashboard in around 5 minutes. Note that Class 4 SD cards can take up to 3 times longer so it's well worth investing in the fastest card you
can find.
