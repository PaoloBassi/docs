This sample project will get you started blinking LEDs on the **{{ $device.name }}** using only javascript. For this project you will need some additional hardware, namely a basic LED, a breadboard and a 220 ohm resistor.

In this sample project we use the onboard analog-to-digital converter of the **{{ $device.name }}** to read distance measurements from an Infrared Proximity Sensor (Sharp GP2Y0A21YK), we then publish this data to the Samsung SAMI.IO data service.
