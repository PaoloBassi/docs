An application is a group of devices of the same type that all run the same code. When you provision a device, it is added to a specific application, but can be migrated to another application at any time.

To create an application, simply select the **{{ $device.name }}** type from the drop-down list, type in a name, and click *Create new application*:

This will take you to the dashboard for your newly created application, where you can manage your whole fleet of **{{ $device.name }}s**.
